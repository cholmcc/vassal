Debian package of VASSAL
------------------------

To build this Debian package somewhat cleanly, I by-passed the
upstream build system (Maven) entirely, and hand-crafted the build
directly in debian/rules.

The package will integrated in to the desktop automatically.  The
shell executable has been updated to be more flexible than upstream.

Reminder: To make new Debian release, do

   DEBEMAIL=... \
      dch -release-heuristic log --no-auto-nmu -i "..."
