.SH NAME
vassal \- play board and card games
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vassal
.RI [ options ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBvassal\fP command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBvassal\fP is a program that allows you to play various board and
card games on the computer, both locally (\fIhot seat\fP), live via
the net (\fIon-line\fP), or as \fIPlay-by-EMail\fP (PBEM).
.PP
Games are available as \fImodules\fP which can be downloaded from the
VASSAL library at
.RS
.sp 1
.UR
https://vassalengine.org
.UE .
.RE
.PP
There are a variety of games available ranging from classic games like
Chess, over Euro-style games, to Wargames (the latter is clearly the
dominant category).
.PP
Downloaded modules are registered in a local library that allows users
to quickly access previously played games. 
.PP
\fBvassal\fP also has a mode to create new or edit existing modules
(options \fB\-\-new\fP and \fB\-\-edit\fP, respectively).
.PP
\fBvassal\fP allows for module to be \fIscripted\fP through an
internal \fIBeanShell\fP (\fBbsh\fP(1)) interpreter.  Some modules
have almost no scripting and only provide the playing components as
virtual elements, while other modules use fairly complicated scripting
to automatise many aspects or enforce rules of a game.
.PP
\fBvassal\fP also allows module designers to include custom Java
classes to implement new features in a module which are not easily
encoded into \fIBeanShell\fP scripts.  
.PP
\fBvassal\fP \fIdoes not\fP have facilities for artificial
intelligence (or automatised) opponents, and will never be able to
accommodate that. 
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h,\-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-c,\-\-chatlog
Echo error log to chat log.
.TP
.BI \-e,\-\-edit \ module
Edit the module \fImodule\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-edit\-extension \ extension
Edit the extension \fIextension\fP (typically ending in \fB.vmdx\fP).
Note that the corresponding module (typically ending in \fB.vmod\fP)
\fImust\fP be known to VASSAL.  That is, you \fImust\fP have the
module in your module library by opening the module at least once,
before opening its extension.
.TP
.BI \-i,\-\-import \ adc2\-gamebox
Imports the \fIAide de Champ\fP (version 2) gamebox
\fIadc2-gamebox\fP, and opens the editor or the newly created VASSAL
module.
.TP
.BI \-l,\-\-load \ module
.TQ
.BI \-l,\-\-load \ save
.TQ
.BI \-l,\-\-load \ log
Open the module \fImodule\fP, game save \fIsave\fP, or play log
\fIlog\fP in the VASSAL player.
.sp 1
Note, when loading a game save (typically ending in \fB.vsav\fP) or
play log (typically ending in \fB.vlog\fP), then the corresponding
module (typically ending in \fB.vmod\fP) \fImust\fP be known to
VASSAL.  That is, you \fImust\fP have the module in your module
library by opening the module at least once, before opening the save
or log.
.TP
.B \-m,\-\-manage
Opens up the module manager (default if no other option is specified).
.TP
.B \-n,\-\-new
Create a new module. 
.TP
.BI \-\-new\-extension \ module
Create a new module extension to \fImodule\fP. 
.TP
.B \-\-version
Report the version of VASSAL to standard output and exit.
.PP
Below are some options that are \fIspecific\fP to the Debian
installation.
.TP
.BI \-D variable=value
Pass the assignment of \fIvariable\fP to \fIvalue\fP to the underlying
Java process.  See \fIjava\fP(1) for more.
.TP
.B \-g,\-\-debug
Run the VASSAL process in a debugger \fBjdb\fP(1). 
.TP
.BI \-s,\-\-source \ directory
Set VASSAL source directory for debugger.  This option can be
specified multiple times, or \fIdirectory\fP can be a colon \fB:\fP
separated list of directories.
.TP
.B \-\-direct
By-pass the module manager and run player, editor, ..., directly
(useful when debugging)
.SH FILE TYPES
.TP
.IB module .vmod
A module file.  These files contains the definition of a module, such
as the board, pieces, cards, and so on.  The can also contained
predefined scenarios, tutorials, and additional information.
.TP
.IB save .vsav
Save of a game state.  These are snapshots of the game state at the
time of the save.  These are useful for saving a game to resume from
at a later time, or as definitions of scenarios.
.TP
.IB log .vlog
Play log.  These contain the \fIfull\fP log (since the time of
recording) of a play of a module.  This is typically what one would
exchange in the PBEM play-mode.
.TP
.IB extension .vmdx
A module extension.  Module extensions are similar to modules, but
augment a module with more elements, such as new counters, boards,
cards, and so on.
.PP
All of these file types are really \fIZip\fP (\fBzip\fP(1)) archives.
Modules and extensions contain an XML file that describes the content
of the module, along with data files such as images, documentation,
and so on.  Save and log archive files contain an obfuscated custom
format binary file that contains the game state and, in case of log
files, history.
.SH INSTALLATION
On Debian, the \fBVASSAL\fP Java JAR file is installed in 
.RS
.sp 1
\fI/usr/share/vassal/lib/Vengine.jar\fP
.sp 1

with a symbolic link in
